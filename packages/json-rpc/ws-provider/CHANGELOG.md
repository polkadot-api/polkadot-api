# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.4.0 - 2025-02-26

### Added

- It switches endpoint/reconnects if the current endpoint doesn't support the critical methods.

## 0.3.6 - 2024-11-18

### Fixed

- `followEnhancer` should resend the errored chainHead_v1_follow request.

## 0.3.5 - 2024-11-15

### Fixed

- Added an internal `followEnhancer` to address issues with certain RPC providers where misconfigured middlewares incorrectly trigger errors on `chainHead_v1_follow` requests, even though the client hasn't reached the 2-subscription limit.

## 0.3.4 - 2024-10-31

### Added

- New interface `WsProviderConfig` and and overload which accepts this interface. This config interface allows to setup the desired timeout time at which the WebSocket should retry the connection.

### Fixed

- Close socket connection when internal timeout is reached to prevent race-conditions.
- Close socket connection when switching connections before the previous connection has been established.

## 0.3.3 - 2024-10-31

- Accidental release (please don't use it)

## 0.3.2 - 2024-10-11

### Fixed

## 0.3.1 - 2024-10-05

### Fixed

- Target ES2022 when bundling

## 0.3.0 - 2024-10-03

### Added

- Introduced support for multiple endpoints. The client now rotates between provided endpoints in case of connection issues.
- Added two options for introspection on protocol status:
  - Pass a `statusChange` callback when creating the client to receive updates on the connection status.
  - Call the `getStatus` function on the `WsJsonRpcProvider` to retrieve the current status of the protocol layer.

### Changed

- The client can now proactively trigger a switch to a different endpoint, giving users more control over which endpoint to use.

### Fixed

- Automatic timeout handling: the client will now timeout if the connection to the RPC doesn't open in a timely manner and will attempt to reconnect with the next available RPC endpoint.
